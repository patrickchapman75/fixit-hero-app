# Reasoning Protocol

You MUST follow this process for every request:
1. **Context Check**: Use `@Codebase` to find relevant files. Do not guess filenames.
2. **Thinking Phase**: Start your response with a `<thinking>` block. 
   - Analyze the current state and architectural impact.
   - List potential side effects (especially React re-renders or Vite HMR issues).
   - Plan the exact changes step-by-step.
3. **Execution**: Provide code using "Diffs" to save tokens. Avoid rewriting entire files unless necessary.
4. **Verification**: Use `grep` or search to see where your changes impact the rest of the app. Use the terminal to run `npm run lint` or tests if available.
