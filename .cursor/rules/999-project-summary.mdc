# Project Handover & Summary Protocol

You are responsible for maintaining project "memory." To prevent context loss when the user switches models:

1. **The Source of Truth**: Always refer to the `@PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` file in the root directory.
2. **Auto-Update**: After every significant task (new feature, major refactor, or bug fix), you MUST ask the user: "Should I update the PROJECT_SUMMARY.md?" 
3. **Update Content**: When updating, include:
   - **Current State**: What was just built/fixed.
   - **Architecture**: Any new patterns or global state changes.
   - **Next Steps**: Exactly what needs to be done next so the next AI agent can start immediately.
4. **Switching Models**: If the user says "I am switching models," you must generate a concise "Handover Summary" block in the chat that they can copy and paste to the new model.

*Goal: Make the transition between models (e.g., Claude to Gemini) seamless.*
